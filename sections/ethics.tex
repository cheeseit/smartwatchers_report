From an ethical point of view, there will be no major issues for the experimentation that will be conducted. The equipment and the data used will be the authors/university property. The authors will not eavesdrop other people devices that are not involved in the experimentation.
The publication of our paper could bring ethical issues as the smartwatch market is expanding and indeed, if this research comes up with security flaws they could be used in an evil way by others. That is why the paper produced will evaluate the ethical problems brought by the research (if any).
