\subsubsection{Traffic investigation}
The packets we see are only  the null and polling packages. We are only looking at channel 0  on which these packets are send. Sometimes some other packets are send over this channel. These packets are not picked up by the master device. We have found that in the connection set up these packet types are disallowed and this is the reason why these packets are not found in the HCI of the master device. As you can see in figure . The connection settings are set only to accept these kinds of packets. All the packets that are send over this channel which are not poll or null are of the types that are disallowed. \pend
The reason why these packets are send is unknown.
\subsubsection{The rogue packets}
The rogue types of rogues packets can be seen here.
