\label{subsec:problems}
There are a few problems we have encountered during the project. The main problem is that we cannot see the most important data that is send. This being the pairing process and the data that is exchanged between the smartwatch and an other android device. The only traffic visible are the poll and null messages that are send over channel 0. This is because the Ubertooth cannot follow the faster data rates that are being exchanged. Another problem  is identifying the rogue packets.
