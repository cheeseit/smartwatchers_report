\label{subsec:problems}
There are a few problems that have been encountered during the project. 
The main problem is that the data send cannot be seen. Indeed, the Ubertooth, even though already powerful, cannot sniff packets that are going at high speed using the Bluetooth 3.0+HS. \\
While using the Ubertooth, the only traffic visible (after catching the UAP and the clock) are the POLL, NULL and other link control packets. These are all send over channel 0.\\
Another problem came up when trying to correlate the data between the packets seen from the Ubertooth and from the HCI layer. The problem was that the packets could not be seen on the HCI. Seeing the output of the the Ubertooth the hope was that there could still be some important information send on this channel. After some investigation these packets were not meant to be seen on the HCI level. The assumption made was wrong and nothing could be gained from this experiment.

The Ubertooth is a fairly new open source device. It is under active development and the tools keep improving and changing. An upgrade on the hardware of this device would be needed in order to achieve. \\
In addition, only a few people are working with it, which makes it hard to find information and examples about the Ubertooth.
