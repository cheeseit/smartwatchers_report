\label{subsec:problems}
There are a few problems we have encountered during the project. The main problem is that we cannot see the most important data that is send. This being the pairing process and the data that is exchanged between the smartwatch and another android device. The only traffic visible are the POLL, NULL and some rogue packets that are send over channel 0. \pend Another problem arises  when trying to correlate the packets we do with the Ubertooth to something that can be seen. The packets that we can see on HCI are hard to correlate to the packets we see on physical layer. This is because we do not know what the normal traffic looks like it hard to say anything about the rogue packets we see. It expected that these packets contain some kind of information for the HCI, but are not certain. These packets are also encrypted. \pend
The Ubertooth is a fairly new device and it's primary use is not what we are trying to use it for. It is under development and the tools keep improving and changing and improving. The information of the mailing list is often outdated. Also there are not many people trying do this. This makes it hard to find a lot of information and examples about how to use the Ubertooth.% do not know if this is needed but i will put it here anyway.
