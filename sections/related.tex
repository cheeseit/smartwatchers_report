The inspiration for doing this project comes from this white paper \cite{mryan2014ble}. This paper explains how BTLE works and how you can exploit it. In the Future work Ryan talks about doing a man in the middle attack, but in a recent talk he had \cite{hitbox_mike_ryan} it was said this was already done. \\
However, this kind of MiTM attacks wasn't performed on the 3.0 version, as this version is known to be more complicated, this is why we chose to look into it by trying to break into a smartwatch.\\
Another paper we used to be sure of our choice is this \cite{chai20126}, which gives an explanation about Bluetooth, how it works, its security mechanisms and tools to use to exploit and inspect Bluetooth.
