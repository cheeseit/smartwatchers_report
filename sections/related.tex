Research to related to our research is primarily done on the new Bluetooth version 4.0 with can have a Classical and LE systems. The inspiration for the project comes from the this white paper \cite{mryan2014ble}. This paper explains how BTLE works and how you can exploit it. In the Future work Ryan talks about doing a man in the middle attack, but in a recent talk he had \cite{hitbox_mike_ryan} it was said this was already done. Another paper we used is this \cite{chai20126}. This paper gives an explanation about Bluetooth, how it works, security mechanisms and tools to use to exploit and inspect Bluetooth.
