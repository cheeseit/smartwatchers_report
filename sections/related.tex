The inspiration for doing this project came from \textit{this paper} \cite{mryan2014ble}, it explains how BTLE works and how it can be exploited. In the Future work part, Ryan talks about doing a man in the middle attack, but in a recent talk he had \cite{hitbox_mike_ryan}, it has been said that this was already done. \\
However, this kind of Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks was not performed on the 3.0 version, as this version is known to be more complicated, this is why the authors chose to look into it by trying to break into a smartwatch.\\
Chai et. al. \cite{chai20126} is another paper used as a base for this project, it gives an explanation about Bluetooth, how it works, its security mechanisms and tools to use to exploit and inspect Bluetooth.
