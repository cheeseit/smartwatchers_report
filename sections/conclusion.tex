The tools used in this project are not useful for inspecting the communication between the SW2 and another device. The only thing that can be seen are the discovery, keep alive and control packets. This makes the Ubertooth unable analysis about the traffic between the SW2 and a smartphone. This is because the SW2 uses Bluetooth 3.0. With Bluetooth 3.0 most of the packets are send with a data rate that Ubertooth cannot follow. On the other hand the Ubertooth can be used to the follow discoverable Bluetooth devices on the network and can uniquely identify them.\pend
However by investigating the HCI layer we saw a interesting thing. The smartwatch is using the JustWork protocol. Which means that no PIN code exchanged/comparison is needed between the two devices. That makes the pairing process weak against MiTM attack.
%From what we can see from the pairing process was that is the data send is encrypted and that is the key exchange is done properly.
Ubertooth is still under development. The tools are still being improved and there is not enough documentation about how to properly use them. With time this will get better, but for Bluetooth 3.0 it is not a very useful tool. It is of better use for Bluetooth 4.0 low energy as proven by Mike Ryan. However a solution could be to use a proprietary tool such as the FTS4BT Frontline sniffer \cite{FTS4BT} that are able to sniff any Bluetooth protocols. The only issue with this hardware is that it is really expensive. Then it was not possible to acquire this kind of hardware for this project due to budget issue.

In the future experiments can be done with a smartwatch that Bluetooth 4.0 which transfer data in low energy mode. The current focus of the Ubertooth project is on the Low Energy mode of Bluetooth 4.0. This kind of communication is something the Ubertooth can easily follow and decrypt.
