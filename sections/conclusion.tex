The tools used in this project are not useful for inspecting the communication between the SW2 and another device. The only thing that can be seen are the discovery, keep alive and  "rogue" packets. This makes the Ubertooth not very useful to do any kind of analysis about the traffic between the SW2 and another device. This is because the SW2 uses Bluetooth 3.0. With Bluetooth 3.0  most of the packets are send with a data rate that Ubertooth cannot follow. \pend  On the other hand the Ubertooth can be used to the follow discoverable Bluetooth devices on the network and can uniquely identify them. The SW2 is easy is program. 
%From what we can see from the pairing process was that is the data send is encrypted and that is the key exchange is done properly.
Ubertooth is still under development. The tools are still being improved and there is not enough documentation about how to properly use them. With time this will get better and with the if Bluetooth 4.0 stays the way it is it will be tool that can be nice to use do all kinds of fun stuff. But for Bluetooth 3.0 it is not a very useful tool and if we would want to inspect this communication there are some tools that can do this, but these are far too expensive for such a small project.
 \pend
In the future experiments can be done with a smartwatch that Bluetooth 4.0 which transfer data in low energy mode. The current focus of the Ubertooth project is on the Low Energy mode of Bluetooth 4.0, because this is something the Ubertooth can easily decrypt and follow. 
To further inspect what the Ubertooth can and cannot pick up. One thing that can be done is manually setting up a connection between devices and send different kinds of data. During the project this has been done with some standard apps that are used avaiable on the SW2, but with some more control maybe more can be seen. \pend
Another thing that can be investigated is the Smart Connect itself. This is an important app for all Sony devices that you use on mobile devices. The pairing process and the administration of the app's is done here. \pend
