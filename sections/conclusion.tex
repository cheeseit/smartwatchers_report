The tools we have bought are not useful for the for the things we want to inspect. We did see that on the channel which all the keep alive packets are send is not only used for this purpose. Ubertooth can be used to the follow discoverable Bluetooth devices on the network and can uniquely identify them. On the other hand it is not useful to inspect Bluetooth 3.0 messages, because the rate at which the data is sent is too fast for the Ubertooth is sniff. We have learned that the smartwatch is easy is program. From what we can see from the pairing process was that is the data send is encrypted and that is the key exchange is done properly. 
In the future experiments can be done with a smartwatch that Bluetooth 4.0 which transfer data in low energy mode. 
To further inspect what the Ubertooth can and cannot pick up. There could be made an app which makes an connection without the Smart Connect app and look when the data is still found by the bluetooth. We have not done this, because we wanted to investigate the smartwatch. If you are making an app you will not setup your own Bluetooth connection, but use the SDK and Smart Connect instead
