\textit{This project aims to investigate how secure the communication between a smartwatch and a smartphone is. It has been done using an Android phone, Sony SW2 Smartwatch and an open source Bluetooth dongle named Ubertooth One.}\pend
\textit{It was found that the tools used are not able to sniff the connection between the devices. Because the SW2 uses Bluetooth 3.0 with high speed, the Ubertooth cannot follow these fast packets. The only detectable packets are the discovery, keep alive and control packets.}\pend
\textit{However, by investigating the HCI layer, it was discovered that the smartwatch uses the JustWork association model: No PIN code exchange at the pairing process, making a MiTM attack possible.}\\
