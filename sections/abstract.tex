Nowadays, bluetooth technology is being more and more used, especially with the IoT (Internet of Things) such as wireless speakers, smartwatches and so on.\\
This project aims to investigate how secure is the communication between a smartwatch and a smartphone. It has been done using an Android phone, Sony SW2 Smartwatch and an open source Bluetooth dongle named Ubertooth One.\\

It was found that the tools used are not efficient enough to sniff the connection between the devices. Because the SW2 uses Bluetooth 3.0 with high speed, the ubertooth cannot follow these fast packets. The only detectable packets are the discovery, keep alive and control packets.\\
However, by investigating the HCI layer, it was discovered that the smartwatch uses the JustWork association model: No PIN code exchange at pairing process, making it very weak against MiTM attack.\\

In order to make this project successful, a proprietary dongle such as the FTS4BT could be used for bluetooth 3.0, costing about 5000 euros.
