\subsubsection{Sony smartwatch 2}
\label{subsubsec:sw2}
The smartwatch that was chosen to do the project with is the Sony 
Smartwatch 2. It is a cheap watch and it is programmable. The SDK has recently been updated and is easy to use. We have used the SDK to quickly make an application. There are many examples which are easily installed. These examples were used to generate traffic for the Ubertooth to detect. This sped up the process of finding targeting and decoding the packets. 
All the Sony devices use an application called Smart Connect. This application keeps track of all the devices that want to make contact with the phone. It also keeps track of the applications that are installed on the watch. Whenever the pairing is stopped between the phone and the watch all the previous installed applications are removed from the watch until they are paired again.
