Information exchanged between smartwatches and smartphones are private and need good security in order not to leak sensitive information and be sure of the integrity of the data. 
The main mean of communication between smartwatches and smartphones is Bluetooth.
The use of low-power communication makes it more likely that there will be security issues with the communication and that encryption might not be set up as it is asking a lot of computation resources. 
This paper will try to answer these questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] How secure is the Bluetooth communication between smartphone and smartwatches?
\item[•]Is it possible to eavesdrop any data exchanged during this communication?
\item[•]Is it possible to change the content of the data exchanged?
\item[•]Is it possible to take control of a smartwatch and/or the smartphone?
\item[•]How the vulnerabilities found (if any) could be addressed?
\end{itemize}
