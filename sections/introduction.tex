With the uprising of IoT (‘Internet of Things’), more and more wearable devices start to get connected. One of these wearable device is the smartwatch. Smartwatches are used to display informations or notifications coming from a phone through a bluetooth communication. It can also be used to collect data.

With all new technology comes new security concerns. Security issues are even more relevant in the case of small battery reliant devices. As encryption and security can be very computation intensive, this will take huge toll on these devices. The aim of this project will be to investigate how secure the communication between a smartwatch and a smartphone is, and try to find solutions or alternatives to the problems found in our investigation.
