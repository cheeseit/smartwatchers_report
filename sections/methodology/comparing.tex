The two previous experiments have been done in the same way in order to be able to identify and correlate informations between the two layers.
Indeed after analysing raw data from the Ubertooth it was quite straightforward to conclude that the data was encrypted and/or encapsulated. 
As the data sent over the air was not human readable the authors monitored the same traffic two layers up (before encryption/encapsulation). The two results were then correlated to deduce what was done at the LMP.
