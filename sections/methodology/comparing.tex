To compare we have used both the Ubertooth and bt\_snoop from the android device. The information retrieved from both of the sources is then compared. Both of the the sources work with timestamps. We will use this timestamps to say something about which message will be which. On of the problems is that the bt\_snoop is more precise than the Ubertooth and will give a more accurate timestamp. Another problem is that more than one thing can happen within the same timestamp.
%The two previous experiments have been done in the same way in order to be able to identify and correlate informations between the two layers.
%Indeed after analysing raw data from the Ubertooth it was quite straightforward to conclude that the data was encrypted and/or encapsulated. 
%As the data sent over the air was not human readable the authors monitored the same traffic two layers up (before encryption/encapsulation). The two results were then correlated to deduce what was done at the LMP.
