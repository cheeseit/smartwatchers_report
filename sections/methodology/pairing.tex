During the pairing process some critical information are exchanged. Indeed as explained in the literature review master and slave are encrypting data thanks to several parameters common to each other: a key, a salt and a clock. These parameters are exchanged between master and slave during the pairing. This is what an attacker want to know to be able to decrypt packets and understand what is exchanged.
Many papers have discussed the way to gather these information. Indeed in order to retrieve them, an attacker would have first to see the pairing mechanism. That is why it is require to de-authenticate the user by making it believe his device is not working. Naturally the user will then re-pair himself with his device. This is where the attacker is able to see the different parameters exchanged. 
This paper will explain how to retrieve these informations and explain how to use these information to decrypt a packet.
